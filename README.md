# Tiny NextJS App
## Intro
Built with `create-next-app`, this is a super simple NextJS app that uses MongoDB for the database and is containerized to run using Docker compose.

## Quick start
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/teamups-inc/tiny-nextjs-app.git`

2. CD into the repo: `cd /path/to/tiny-nextjs-app`

3. Start via docker compose: `docker-compose up`

4. Once running, visit `http://localhost:3000/` to load the app--the first load might be slow.
